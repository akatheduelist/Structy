Write a function, five_sort, that takes in a list of numbers as an argument. The function should rearrange elements of the list such that all 5s appear at the end. Your function should perform this operation in-place by mutating the original list. The function should return the list.

Elements that are not 5 can appear in any order in the output, as long as all 5s are at the end of the list.
