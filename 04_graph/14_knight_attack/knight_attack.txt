knight attack
A knight and a pawn are on a chess board. Can you figure out the minimum number of moves required for the knight to travel to the same position of the pawn? On a single move, the knight can move in an "L" shape; two spaces in any direction, then one space in a perpendicular direction. This means that on a single move, a knight has eight possible positions it can move to.

Write a function, knightAttack, that takes in 5 arguments:

n, kr, kc, pr, pc

n = the length of the chess board
kr = the starting row of the knight
kc = the starting column of the knight
pr = the row of the pawn
pc = the column of the pawn
The function should return a number representing the minimum number of moves required for the knight to land ontop of the pawn. The knight cannot move out-of-bounds of the board. You can assume that rows and columns are 0-indexed. This means that if n = 8, there are 8 rows and 8 columns numbered 0 to 7. If it is not possible for the knight to attack the pawn, then return null.

knightAttack(8, 1, 1, 2, 2); // -> 2
knightAttack(8, 1, 1, 2, 3); // -> 1
knightAttack(8, 0, 3, 4, 2); // -> 3
knightAttack(8, 0, 3, 5, 2); // -> 4
knightAttack(24, 4, 7, 19, 20); // -> 10
knightAttack(100, 21, 10, 0, 0); // -> 11
knightAttack(3, 0, 0, 1, 2); // -> 1
knightAttack(3, 0, 0, 1, 1); // -> null
